Next generation sequencing data

A hepatocyte and a mature motor neuron in our body shares identical genetic information, but each of them executes different genetic programs.  This is possible, because of  the regulation of gene accessibility during and after organism development.

In the case of pluripotent stem cells, with their unique ability to differentiate into all cell types in our body, these restrictions are very complicated. A big network of epigenetic readers and writers are interacting together on the chromatin to create a balance between differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into other lineages. Therefore, deletion of an epigenetic reader or writer just increases the probability of  cell differentiation toward a specific cell lineage and you can not talk about it in an absolute manner. For example, MGA (MAX Gene-Associated Protein) deletion promotes both extra-embryonic endoderm fate and  ectopic activation of meiosis-related genes. However, the effects of MGA deletion is not restricted to these two cellular processes.

In this project, I used machine learning methods to identify the correlation between the chromatin occupancy of PRC1.6 subunits (a suppressive epigenetic regulator) in embryonic stem cells and  activation or suppression of genes after cell differentiation.
